# Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen 👋

Nothing too fancy here—just a bunch of programs my professor **brilliantly thought we needed** for practical files.  
Feel free to marvel at my coding skills (or lack thereof). 😅

You can **download the zip file** and run the programs like a normal human being with a modern compiler. 
Or just copy paste them to web compilers.

I personally used **GCC** because, well, why complicate things?

```bash
# Compile the program
gcc -o executable_name file_name.c

# Run the program
./executable_name
